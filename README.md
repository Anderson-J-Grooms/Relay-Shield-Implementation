This is the repository for my application of the Arduino Relay-Shield. It is a an integration of an Arduino with a VEX system robot, utilizing the relay shield to control motor power. A complete breakdown of the project and implimentation steps are located in the wiki of this repository. A video demo of the project can be found at this link: https://youtube.com/shorts/wyTqpUuQKzU?feature=share
